# XRay_Classification-tensorflow-
Pneumonia is an inflammatory condition of the lung primarily affecting the small air sacs known as alveoli. Symptoms typically include some combination of productive or dry cough, chest pain, fever and difficulty breathing. accurately diagnosing pneumonia is a difficult task that requires trained specialists and confirmation through clinical history. With deep learning, this task can be performed even by non-specialists. This notebook will explain how to build an X-ray image classification model from scratch using CNN architecture and TPUs efficiently in order to predict whether an X-ray scan shows presence of pneumonia.
